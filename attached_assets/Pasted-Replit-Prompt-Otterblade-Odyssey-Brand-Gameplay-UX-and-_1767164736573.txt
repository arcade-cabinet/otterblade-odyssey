Replit Prompt: Otterblade Odyssey Brand, Gameplay, UX, and Narrative Alignment Spec
You are building Otterblade Odyssey: Zephyros Rising, a modern, polished, side-view (2.5D) action platformer. You are responsible for ensuring brand consistency across gameplay, visuals, UI/UX, cutscenes, and narrative progression. You may choose any libraries/tech stack required; focus on the experience, cohesion, and correctness.
1) Brand DNA (Non-Negotiable)
Emotional tone:
Classic woodland-epic adventure in the spirit of Redwall: warm, brave, hopeful, “cozy-but-heroic.” This is not grimdark, not high-fantasy bombast, and not sci-fi neon spectacle. The world should feel lived-in: stone, wood, cloth, lantern light, moss, ivy, banners, carved details, paper maps.
Aesthetic:
Premium modern production values (smooth animation, lighting, particles, subtle post-FX), but grounded materials. Prefer painterly storybook realism. Avoid generic AAA fantasy key-art tropes (glowing energy swords, floating neon castles, anime poses).
Visual anchors:
Mossy abbey/castle architecture (warm stone, arches, carvings)
Lanterns/candles/hearthlight, dawn mist, god rays
Textures: fur strands, cloth weave, wood grain, stone pitting, ironwork
Magic is subtle and rare (firefly-like motes, faint rune shimmer), never “laser”
Color language:
Warm greens + honey gold + cool misty blues; controlled accents per biome. No saturated neon gradients as the default.
2) Player Character: Otter (Animation + Rigging Requirements)
The otter must feel physical, expressive, and readable in side view.
Player body segmentation / articulation (required):
Implement the player with articulated zones suitable for classic platformer readability:
Lower body (legs/hips): run, stop, skid, crouch, slide, land compression
Upper body (torso/arms): sword-ready stance, swing arcs, parry/guard pose
Head/neck: subtle follow-through, look direction, breathing/idle
Cloak/scarf: secondary motion (wind, acceleration)
Fur: visible strand-like detail and subtle ripple in motion; do not overdo like “electric glow.” The fur should react to speed/jumps and wind direction.
Movement expectations (Prince of Persia / classic platformer quality bar):
Tight, responsive controls with subtle weight; no floatiness.
Jump buffering and coyote time.
Reliable grounding detection; no “false airborne” or “sticky edges.”
Crouch affects hitbox + animation + movement (crouch-walk, slide).
Attacks have windup, active frames, recovery; include hit-stop on impact (subtle).
Edge cases: slopes, ledges, platform corners, moving platforms (if used).
Hitboxes:
Separate hurtboxes for upper vs lower (for crouch and overhead attacks).
Crouch must reduce height of hurtbox.
Sword attack uses an arc/box hitbox aligned to animation frames.
3) Core Enemy Roster (must be coherent and varied)
Enemies must read clearly in side-view silhouettes and belong to the grounded woodland-epic tone (no demons, no sci-fi robots).
Minimum enemy archetypes:
Skirmisher: fast, low HP, closes distance; punishable.
Shielded/Armored: slower, blocks frontal attacks; requires timing, back-hit, or stun.
Ranged: throws stones/darts; telegraphs shots; forces movement.
Flyer/Leaper: engages vertical space; forces jump timing or anti-air.
Trap creature: ambush from ground/walls; teaches caution.
Elite: miniboss-tier enemy with 2–3 move patterns.
All enemies must have:
Telegraphs, readable animations, and fair windows.
Distinct audio cues (subtle, non-cartoonish).
“Lived-in” gear/materials: leather, cloth, bone, iron; not glowing tech.
4) Boss Design (periodic, cinematic, fair)
Bosses are chapter moments. They should be pattern-based, not HP sponges.
Boss requirements:
Clear arena setup (space, hazards, checkpoints).
Distinct phases (at least 2) triggered by HP thresholds or pattern loops.
Telegraphs + punish windows.
A “signature” move that becomes learnable.
Cutscene beats: boss arrival (1–2 seconds), boss defeat epilogue (2–4 seconds), never interrupting flow harshly.
Boss examples in tone:
A massive badger-like guardian corrupted by fear
A siege beast battering abbey gates
A silent duelist (mirror-otter or stoat champion) Avoid: lava demon, neon dragon, cosmic monster as default.
5) Biomes and Transitions (parallax + story continuity)
Biomes must feel like contiguous places, not random theme parks.
Biome set (anchored to story progression):
Abbey exterior (forest approach, bridge, gatehouse)
Abbey interior (great hall, library, cloisters, kitchens)
Dungeon/catacombs (stone, torchlight, damp, roots)
Courtyard/gardens (sunlight, banners, training yard)
Rooftops/rafters (wind, height, bells, shingles)
Outer ruins/river path (mossy remnants, fog)
Optional later “aether” should still feel ancient/stone/wood—magical but grounded.
Biome transitions must be elegant:
Fade-based chapter plates (storybook cutscenes) with subtle parallax drift.
Gameplay transition zones: light shifts, particles change, materials change gradually.
Parallax layers: foreground foliage/props, midground platforms, deep background architecture/forest haze.
6) Cutscenes & Storyboarding (Redwall-anchored chapter plates)
Cutscenes are storybook plates: warm, noble, quiet courage. Minimal/no text.
Required chapter plate set (generate image/video assets consistently):
Approach: outside abbey walls at dawn; otter arriving with cloak and sword.
Gatehouse: lantern-lit bridge and gate; banners stirring; sense of threshold.
Great Hall Oath: candle-lit interior, otter resolves to defend.
Library/Map Table: parchment map, relics, quiet planning moment.
Dungeon Descent: torchlight, roots, damp stone, danger below.
Courtyard Rally: sunlight, training yard, allies implied.
Rooftop Wind: higher stakes, bells/rafters, wind in fur.
Final Ascent: toward Zephyros / high keep / sanctuary—still abbey-like.
For each plate, ensure:
Practical gear, grounded materials.
Soft volumetric lighting, mist, fireflies, subtle magic only.
Consistent otter design (face shape, cloak, sword silhouette).
Option for textless and text-integrated variants.
7) UI/UX: Mobile-first game feel (no browser sabotage)
The UI must be responsive, full-screen, and prevent browser gestures from interrupting gameplay.
Input capture requirements:
Prevent page scroll, pull-to-refresh, overscroll, double-tap zoom.
Use pointer/touch best practices: touch-action: none, prevent default where needed.
Fullscreen-like immersive mode (as feasible) and stable layout.
Inputs must not “stick” if finger slides off button—handle cancel/out events.
HUD requirements:
Top HUD: health (hearts), shards, score, optional biome name, subtle quest/message ticker.
Quest messages: short, storybook tone (“Reach the Gatehouse”, “Find the Abbey Key”, etc.).
No intrusive UI during cutscenes; fade HUD out.
Mobile control layout (required):
Left side: split “Simon Says” style two-button pad (Left / Right) large and thumb-friendly.
Right side: four-button cluster (diamond or 2×2):
Jump
Attack
Crouch/Slide
Special/Interact (or Dodge if chosen)
Buttons: semi-transparent, tactile press feedback, no hover dependency, accessible sizing.
8) Game Loop & Progression (classic wisdom)
Incorporate lessons from classic games:
Teach mechanics safely: movement → jump → crouch → attack → enemies → traps → miniboss → boss.
Place checkpoints before major difficulty spikes.
Risk/reward with shards (optional: spend at abbey shrines for upgrades).
Maintain fairness: clear telegraphs, readable collisions, consistent physics.
9) Consistency Enforcement (self-check list you must apply)
Before declaring work complete, verify:
Otter silhouette is consistent across gameplay, cutscenes, and any generated assets.
Biome palette stays within grounded storybook range (no neon drift).
Animations support crouch, leap, attack with clear hitboxes.
Enemies are varied, readable, and fair; bosses have phases and telegraphs.
Mobile controls are robust; browser gestures do not disrupt play.
Transitions between levels are emotionally coherent and visually consistent.
10) Deliverables (non-optional)
A cohesive set of chapter transition assets (images and/or short looping videos) for each major level described.
A consistent style guide inside the repo (BRAND.md or similar) describing the above DNA + do/don’t examples.
Game remains playable on desktop and mobile with consistent UX.
Optional: “Do Not Drift” Negative Guidance (enforce)
Avoid:
glowing energy swords, neon sci-fi lighting, floating futuristic castles
anime posing, over-stylized JRPG effects
grimdark gore, demon aesthetics, horror tone
glossy plastic look, sterile minimalism
Prefer:
moss, stone, lantern light, cloth and leather, quiet heroism, storybook realism
