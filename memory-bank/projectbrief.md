# Project Brief

Otterblade Odyssey is a Willowmere-inspired action-platformer built with Astro + Solid + Matter.js that aims to deliver a modular, lore-rich gameplay experience driven by manifest-defined chapters. The project’s current focus is stabilizing chapter 0, removing legacy JavaScript, and transitioning every runtime subsystem to TypeScript ES2022 so the game can be played end-to-end without polyfills or stubs. Documentation, data, and systems must stay synchronized with the TypeScript migration and manifest-driven asset pipeline.
